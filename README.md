This project runs with pnpm, install it if you havenâ€™t already.

It also uses Ultracite, an extension of Biome.js instead of eslint. If using VSCode or forks of VSCode the .vscode settings are included.
If using Zed, copy the following settings into your settings.json.

```
"formatter": {
    "language_server": {
      "name": "biome"
    }
  },
  "code_actions_on_format": {
    "source.fixAll.biome": true,
    "source.organizeImports.biome": true
  },
  "lsp": {
    "biome": {
      "settings": {
        "require_config_file": true
      }
    }
  }
```

Ultracite lints and formats with the following command:

```
pnpm lint
```
